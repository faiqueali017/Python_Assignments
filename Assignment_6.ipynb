    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "1. Re-usability\n",
    "It means reusing some facilities rather than building it again and again. This is done \n",
    "with the use of a class. We can use it ‘n’ number of times as per our need.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Redundancy\n",
    "This is a condition created at the place of data storage (you can say Databases)where the \n",
    "same piece of data is held in two separate places. So the data redundancy is one of the greatest \n",
    "advantages of OOP. If a user wants a similar functionality in multiple classes he/she can go \n",
    "ahead by writing common class definitions for the similar functionalities and inherit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Maintenance\n",
    "This feature is more of a necessity for any programming languages, it helps users from doing\n",
    "re-work in many ways. It is always easy and time-saving to maintain and modify the existing \n",
    "codes with incorporating new changes into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Design Benefits\n",
    "If you are practicing on OOPs the design benefit a user will get is in terms of designing and \n",
    "fixing things easily and eliminating the risks (if any). Here the Object Oriented Programs \n",
    "forces the designers to have a longer and extensive design phase, which results in better \n",
    "designs and fewer flaws. After a time when the program has reached some critical limits, it \n",
    "is easier to program all the non-OOP’s one separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Security\n",
    "With the use of data hiding and abstraction mechanism, we are filtering out limited data to \n",
    "exposure which means we are maintaining security and providing necessary data to view.\n",
    "\n",

    "productivity. This leads to more work done, finish a better program, having more inbuilt \n",
